## Open Source License (AGPL-3.0)

Custom Fields is licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html), a strong copyleft license designed for network software.

### What is AGPL-3.0?

The AGPL-3.0 is similar to the GPL-3.0 but includes an additional provision: if you run modified versions of the software on a network server, you must provide the source code to users of that server.

<Warning>
**Important**: AGPL-3.0 requires your entire application using Custom Fields to be open source, including when used as a network service (SaaS, web applications, APIs).
</Warning>

### Key AGPL-3.0 Obligations

When using Custom Fields under AGPL-3.0, you must:

1. **Share Source Code**: Make your entire application's source code available under AGPL-3.0
2. **Include License**: Preserve all copyright and license notices
3. **State Changes**: Document any modifications you make
4. **Network Disclosure**: Provide source code even for network/SaaS usage
5. **No Additional Restrictions**: Cannot add terms that restrict others' AGPL rights

### Who Can Use AGPL-3.0?

The AGPL-3.0 license is suitable for:
- Open source projects (AGPL-3.0 compatible)
- Non-profit organizations willing to share code
- Educational projects with public code
- Personal learning projects with public repositories

<Note>
Using Custom Fields under AGPL-3.0 is completely free - no payment required. However, you must comply with all AGPL-3.0 obligations.
</Note>

## Commercial License

For organizations that cannot or choose not to comply with AGPL-3.0 requirements, we offer commercial licenses that allow private use without open source obligations.

### Why Choose Commercial?

A commercial license is required if you:
- Want to keep your application code private
- Cannot comply with AGPL-3.0 obligations
- Need to use Custom Fields in proprietary software
- Operate a commercial SaaS without sharing source code
- Require warranty or liability terms beyond AGPL-3.0

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What exactly is the AGPL-3.0 network provision?">
    The AGPL-3.0's key difference from GPL is Section 13: if users interact with your software over a network (web app, API, SaaS), you must provide them with the complete source code. This closes the "ASP loophole" where SaaS providers could use GPL software without sharing modifications.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use Custom Fields in my agency's client projects?">
    Yes, with a commercial license. Your license covers unlimited client projects. The team size limit only applies to developers working directly with Custom Fields code.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How is annual revenue calculated?">
    Include all business revenue from the past 12 months plus any funding (seed, VC, grants). For new companies, use projected annual revenue. We operate on trust - no audits required.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens when my commercial license expires?">
    Your installations continue working forever. You only lose access to updates and support. Renew anytime to regain update access. No functionality is disabled.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I contribute to Custom Fields?">
    Yes! We welcome contributions. By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under AGPL-3.0. Significant contributors may receive commercial licenses.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is Custom Fields compatible with MIT/BSD licensed projects?">
    Only if your entire project is licensed under AGPL-3.0. The AGPL-3.0 is a copyleft license that requires the entire work to be AGPL-3.0. For MIT/BSD projects, you need a commercial license.
