**Custom Fields** is now open source and can be installed directly via Composer for all users. The installation process is the same whether you're using the AGPL-3.0 or Commercial license.

## Requirements

- **PHP**: 8.2 or higher
- **Laravel**: 10.0 or higher (via Filament)
- **Filament**: 3.0 or higher

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install via Composer

```bash
composer require relaticle/custom-fields
```

### 2. Publish Migrations

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="custom-fields-migrations"
```

### 3. Run Migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

That's it! Custom Fields is now installed and ready to use.

## License Activation (Commercial Users Only)

If you're using Custom Fields in a closed-source commercial project, you need to purchase and activate a commercial license.

### License Activation

After purchasing, you'll receive a license key. Add it to your `.env` file:

```env
CUSTOM_FIELDS_LICENSE_KEY=your-license-key-here
```

Or configure it in `config/custom-fields.php`:

```php
return [
    'license_key' => env('CUSTOM_FIELDS_LICENSE_KEY'),
    // other configuration options...
];
```

<Note>
The package will work without a license key, but commercial use without a valid license violates the terms of use. Please ensure you have the appropriate license for your use case.
</Note>

## Publishing Assets (Optional)

### Configuration File

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="custom-fields-config"
```

### Language Files

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="custom-fields-translations"
```

### Views (for customization)

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="custom-fields-views"
```

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify everything is working:

```bash
php artisan about
```

You should see Custom Fields listed in the environment section.

## License Compliance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need a license key for open source projects?">
    No. If your project is open source under AGPL-3.0, you can use Custom Fields without a license key.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I know if I need a commercial license?">
    If your project is closed-source, proprietary, or you cannot comply with AGPL-3.0 requirements (making your code open source), you need a commercial license.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if I don't add a license key?">
    The package will function normally. However, using it commercially without a valid license is a violation of the license agreement. We trust our users to obtain the appropriate license.
  </Accordion>
