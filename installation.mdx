## Commercial License (Closed-Source Projects)

If you're using Custom Fields in a closed-source commercial project, you need to purchase and activate a commercial license.

After purchasing, add your license key to your `.env` file:

```env
CUSTOM_FIELDS_LICENSE_KEY=your-license-key-here
```

<Note>
The package will work without a license key, but commercial use without a valid license violates the terms of use. See our [licensing options](/legal-acknowledgments/license) for more details.
</Note>
